A zsh-theme inspired by [agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) and [bubblewritten](https://github.com/paracorde/dots/blob/master/bubblewritten.zsh-theme).

**Best used with [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and a [nerdfront](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)**

## Installation

***Assuming you are using ohmyzsh***.

Get the sourcefile
```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hohmannr/bubblified/master/bubblified.zsh-theme
```

Move it to your ohmyzsh theme folder
```
$ mv bubblified.zsh-theme $ZSH/themes
```

Open your `.zshrc` and change the theme
```
ZSH_THEME="bubblified"
```

Restart your terminal emulator and enjoy.


## Customization

This theme is built with customization in mind. This means that you should be able to customize colors and icons aswell as add custom bubbles in the theme's style.

### What to do before

***Assuming you are using ohmyzsh***.

Before customization please copy this theme to ohmyzsh's custom theme directory.
```
$ cp $ZSH/themes/bubblified.zsh-theme $ZSH/custom/themes
```

Then edit the theme using your favorite editor, mine is neovim.
```
$ nvim $ZSH/custom/themes/bubblified.zsh-theme
```
To load the edited theme, restart your terminal emulator or source your `.zshrc`
```
$ source ~/.zshrc
```

### Icons

To change icons for the default bubbles, just change their constants under the `# SYMBOL CONSTANTS` section.

### Colors

To change colors for the default bubbles, just change their constants under the `# COLOR CONSTANTS` section. Valid values are `{'black', 'red', 'blue', 'cyan', 'yellow', 'green', 'white', 'magenta'}`, they correspond to the colors set in your terminal.

### Custom Bubbles

#### Simple Bubbles

Simple bubbles are bubbles with the default `bubble_color` and content.

Declare a variable (e.g. the current time)

```
time_bubble="%T"
```
    
Build a bubble by enclosing the variable with `$bubble_left` and `$bubble_right`

```
time_bubble="$bubble_left%T$bubble_right"
```

*OPTIONAL* - If you want a different text color, then add an escape sequence with the color definition

```
time_bubble="$bubble_left%{$fg[red]%}%T$bubble_right"
```

Add the variable to the `PROMPT`

```
PROMPT='...$time_bubble...'
```

#### Fancy Bubbles

Fancy bubbles are in the style of the default `git_bubble`. They consist of multiple segments for which the text and the background can be colored individually.

Define a custom function that echos the bubble's content
        
```
foo () {
    echo -n "left middle right"
}
```

Use the provided `bubblify` function to build custom colored bubble segments

```
foo () {
    echo -n "$(bubblify 0 "left" "black" "red")$(bubblify 1 "middle" "green" "black")$(bubblify "right" "yellow" "magenta")"
}
```

*TIP* - `bubblify {0, 1, 2, 3} "foreground-color" "background-color"` where `0` builds a left segment, `1` builds a middle segment, `2` builds a right segment and `3` builds a whole custom colored bubble with only one segment.

*TIP* - Including `%{$reset_color%}` at the end of the echo will make sure that colors are reset to the default ones after your bubble finishes rendering.

Add the function as a subshell call to the `PROMPT`

```
PROMPT='...$(foo)...'
```
